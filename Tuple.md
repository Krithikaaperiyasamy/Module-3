# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence
## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element 'n' and the element 8 exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple x with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the in operator to check if the string 'n' exists within the tuple.
3. Use the in operator to check if the integer 8 exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```
a=eval(input())
print("n" not in a)
print("8" in a)
```

## Output

## Result
The program successfully checks for the existence of both the character 'n' and the number 8 in the given tuple and prints True for each, confirming their presence.
